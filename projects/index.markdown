## LV2 Flight Software
![Launch-12 Network Diagram](http://psas.github.io/Launch-12/avionics/network_diagram.svg)

The flight software running on [LV2](/rockets/#LV22) is a mix of STM32F4 microcontrollers handling low level code and an Intel Atom main Flight Computer running Linux with a flight executive program written in C. Data is passed through the system via TCP/IP, either on localhost or via the physical ethernet network on the rocket.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/psas/elderberry.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/psas/elderberry)


The main flight computer code is written extremely modularly. Elderberry is a project to tie together all the modules and auto-generate the event loop and `main.c` files just before compilation.

This project was initially a PSU senior capstone project in 2013.

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-shell-lightgrey.svg)

We have used Raspberry Pi's with cameras on flights to record and broadcast video. Some of the particular setup is captured here.


## LV2 Flight Hardware


### Electronics
Homepage: ![github.com/psas](/images/logos/github.png){:.icon} [github.com/psas/avioncs-cad](https://github.com/psas/avionics-cad)

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-EagleCAD-orange.svg)

Main repository for all schematics and board designs on the rocket. This is the main work of the Avionics Team.

To get started you'll need EAGLE CAD version 6.2 or greater.


## Ground Support

### Telemetry Viewer
Homepage: ![github.com/psas](/images/logos/github.png){:.icon} [github.com/psas/telemetry](https://github.com/psas/telemetry)

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-python-green.svg)


We generate large amounts of data on the rocket flight computer. We need to be able to safely and remotely monitor the rocket both while testing new algorithms in the lab, and while in flight. It's web based so that almost any device with a browser can see the data live. We've even broadcast our telemetry live in flight around the world during a flight!

This viewer project was initially a PSU senior capstone project in 2013.


### Commander
Homepage: ![github.com/psas](/images/logos/github.png){:.icon} [github.com/psas/commander](https://github.com/psas/commander)

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-python-green.svg)

This was used to send commands (ARM, power-on, etc.) to any system (ground or flight) via a simple web interface.


### Flight Director Table
Homepage: ![github.com/psas](/images/logos/github.png){:.icon} [github.com/psas/flight-director-table](https://github.com/psas/flight-director-table)


We have a single table with a ground support computer running all the necessary software for launch. This also incorporates ground WiFi hardware, tracking antennas, ground communication systems, and networking gear.



### Launch Tower Computer
Homepage: ![github.com/psas](/images/logos/github.png){:.icon} [github.com/psas/launch-tower](https://github.com/psas/launch-tower)

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-KiCad-orange.svg)

Ignition of the rocket is managed by a small embedded computer at the base of the launch tower. We communicate with this over a ground WiFi link to launch the rocket. It also has a hard data link to the rocket with shore power.



### Launch Tower Control Application 
Homepage: ![github.com/psas](/images/logos/github.png){:.icon} [github.com/psas/launch-tower-comm](https://github.com/psas/launch-tower-comm)

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-python-green.svg)

This is a stand-alone application written in python and kivy that was used in the past to send the arm and launch command to the launch tower computer over a WiFi link

## Special Projects
We have several ongoing projects helping to build on our technical work on amateur rockets. Often these projects have implications for many different rockets we fly, rather than on particular flight or airframe.

### 360Â° Camera
Homepage: [psas.pdx.edu/projects/360-camera/](360-camera) 

For our [LV2](/rockets/#lv22) rocket we envisioned a full, wrap-around camera device that would let you replay video from the launch that would look like you were flying on the rocket!

### GPS
Working GPS on rockets is very difficult. Off-the-self solutions will not work for a number of technical and legal reasons (unless you're very rich). Instead we've worked on our own implementations of GPS in software and hardware:



#### Software Defined Radio GPS Board
Homepage: ![github.com/psas](/images/logos/github.png){:.icon} [github.com/psas/gps-rf-board](https://github.com/psas/gps-rf-board) 

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-EagleCAD-orange.svg)

A circuit board flown on Launch-12 that uses a SDR approach to GPS. The firmware for the board is in the [STM32](https://github.com/psas/stm32) repo along with all the other flight firmware from that launch.

In addition to the firmware this board needed a CPLD for high speed SPI communication to the SDR chip. This was stored in:

 - [github.com/psas/gps-cpld](https://github.com/psas/gps-cpld)



#### GPS Algorithms
Homepage: ![github.com/psas](/images/logos/github.png){:.icon} [github.com/psas/gps](https://github.com/psas/gps)

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-c-blue.svg)

Data from our SDR GPS board and even other GPS projects from around the world can be decoded with this software.



### Cold Gas Reaction Control System
Homepage: ![github.com/psas](/images/logos/github.png){:.icon} [github.com/psas/reaction-control](https://github.com/psas/reaction-control)

Work on a functional cold gas RCS system



## Research
We have some ongoing research topics. Sometimes we just need a place to stuff things while we work on them.

### Liquid Engine Analysis
Homepage: ![github.com/psas](/images/logos/github.png){:.icon} [github.com/psas/liquid-engine-analysis](https://github.com/psas/liquid-engine-analysis)

Bespoke, handmade wrap-around microwave patch antennas specially for rockets.



### Long Distance WiFi
#### Main Project, DxWiFi
Homepage: ![github.com/psas](/images/logos/github.png){:.icon} [github.com/psas/DxWiFi](https://github.com/psas/DxWiFi)

A mission objective is to be able to communicate via WiFi from space -- specifically, have data be transmitted from a COTS IEEE 802.11b module onboard the CubeSat to an inexpensive âDIYâ ground station setup meant for K-12 STEM programs.

We send data back to the ground from our rocket using ordinary WiFi like in your laptop or phone. We're working on pushing IEEE 802.11 to ultra long distance communication.

#### Power Amp for 2.4 GHz band WiFi
Homepage: ![github.com/psas](/images/logos/github.png){:.icon} [github.com/psas/dxwifi-pa](https://github.com/psas/dxwifi-pa)

Work on a high-efficiency power amp (PA) for WiFi in the 2.4 GHz band.
